\title{Process Party Representation Data for House of Representatives}
\usage{
process_reps(data, event)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing "Party representation" data for a single election event from
the House of Representatives. Must include an \code{event} column with a single unique value (e.g.,
"2004", "2007", "2010"). For processing years (2004, 2007, 2010), must include \code{Total} and
\code{LastElectionTotal} columns. A \code{date} column is typically present as mandatory metadata.}

\item{event}{A character string specifying the election year to process. Recognised values are
"2004", "2007", or "2010". Other values result in the data being returned unprocessed.}
}
\value{
A data frame. For recognised election years (2004, 2007, 2010), it contains the standardised
columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{National} (total party representation, renamed from \code{Total})
\item \code{LastElection} (party representation from the last election, renamed from \code{LastElectionTotal})
}
along with all other input columns (e.g., \code{date}, \code{event}). For unrecognised years, the original
data frame is returned unchanged.
}
\description{
Standardises "Party representation" data for the House of Representatives from Australian federal
elections in 2004, 2007, and 2010. This helper function aligns column names by renaming \code{Total} to
\code{National} and \code{LastElectionTotal} to \code{LastElection} for consistency across these years. For other
election years, the data is returned unprocessed with a message.
}
\details{
This function processes "Party representation" data by:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Standardising column names}: For 2004, 2007, and 2010, renames \code{Total} to \code{National} and
\code{LastElectionTotal} to \code{LastElection} using \code{rename_cols()}.
\item \strong{Unrecognised years}: Returns the data unprocessed with an informative message for years
other than 2004, 2007, or 2010.
}
The function assumes the input data frame contains the required columns (\code{event}, \code{Total}, and
\code{LastElectionTotal}) for the specified processing years, as sourced from the AEC "Party representation"
dataset for the House of Representatives.

\examples{
# Sample 2004 data
data_2004 <- data.frame(
  date = "2004-10-09",
  event = "2004",
  Party = "ALP",
  Total = 60,
  LastElectionTotal = 65
)
process_reps(data_2004, "2004")

# Sample unprocessed year (e.g., 2013)
data_2013 <- data.frame(
  date = "2013-09-07",
  event = "2013",
  Party = "LIB",
  National = 90,
  LastElection = 72
)
process_reps(data_2013, "2013")
