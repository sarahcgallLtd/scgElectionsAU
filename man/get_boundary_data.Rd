\title{Retrieve Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundary data}
\usage{
get_boundary_data(
  ref_date,
  level = c("CED", "SED", "POA", "SA1", "MB"),
  type = c("allocation", "correspondence")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ref_date}{Numeric. The reference year for the boundary data. Must be between 2011 and 2024, inclusive.}

\item{level}{Character. The geographic level of the boundary data. One of "CED" (Commonwealth Electoral Division),
"SED" (State Electoral Division), "POA" (Postal Area), "SA1" (Statistical Area Level 1), or "MB" (Mesh Block).
Defaults to "CED".}

\item{type}{Character. The type of boundary data. One of "allocation" or "correspondence". Defaults to "allocation".}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the boundary data for the specified parameters. If multiple files are downloaded,
they are combined into a single data frame, provided they have identical column structures. For the 2011 SA1
correspondence data, additional cleaning is performed to ensure data consistency.
}
\description{
Downloads and processes ABS boundary data (allocation or correspondence files)
for a specified reference year and geographic level from the scgElectionsAU package.
For the special case of 2011 SA1 correspondence data, it handles multiple sheets
from an Excel file and performs additional data cleaning.
}
\details{
This function retrieves boundary data by accessing the \code{abs_boundary_index} dataset in the \code{scgElectionsAU} package,
filtering it based on the provided \code{ref_date}, \code{level}, and \code{type}. It then downloads the corresponding files from
the URLs listed in the index using \code{scgUtils::get_file()}. If multiple files are retrieved, they are combined into
a single data frame using \code{rbind}. For the special case where \code{ref_date = 2011}, \code{level = "SA1"}, and
\code{type = "correspondence"}, the function downloads multiple sheets from an Excel file (sheets 4 to 7), corrects a
known column name typo ("SA1_7DIGICODE_2011" to "SA1_7DIGITCODE_2011"), and performs additional data cleaning steps,
such as renaming columns (e.g., "CD_CODE_2006...2" to "CD_CODE_2006"), removing redundant columns (e.g.,
"CD_CODE_2006...1"), and removing rows with all NA values. The function includes validation checks to ensure the
parameters are valid and that the downloaded data can be combined.
