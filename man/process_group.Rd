\title{Process Senate Group Voting Data}
\usage{
process_group(data, event)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing Senate voting data for a single election event. Must include
an \code{event} column with a single unique value (e.g., "2004", "2007", "2010", "2013", "2016", "2019").
For processing years (2004-2019), must include the \code{Ticket} column. A \code{date} column is typically
present as mandatory metadata. If \code{SittingMemberFl} is present, it will be processed by
\code{\link[=process_elected]{process_elected()}}.}

\item{event}{A character string specifying the election year to process. Recognised values are
"2004", "2007", "2010", "2013", "2016", or "2019". Other values result in the data being returned
unprocessed.}
}
\value{
A data frame. For recognised election years (2004-2019), it contains the standardised column:
\itemize{
\item \code{Group} (group or ticket identifier, renamed from \code{Ticket})
}
along with all other input columns (e.g., \code{date}, \code{event}). If \code{SittingMemberFl} is present, it also
includes the \code{Elected} column as processed by \code{\link[=process_elected]{process_elected()}}. For unrecognised years, the
original data frame is returned unchanged.
}
\description{
Standardises Senate election data for Australian federal elections in 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016,
and 2019 from the AEC datasets "First preferences by state by vote type" and "First preferences by
division by vote type". This helper function aligns column names by renaming \code{Ticket} to \code{Group}
for consistency across these years. If the \code{SittingMemberFl} column is present, it applies the
\code{\link[=process_elected]{process_elected()}} function for additional processing. For other election years, the data is
returned unprocessed with a message.
}
\details{
This function processes Senate voting data by:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Standardising column names}: For 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019, renames \code{Ticket}
to \code{Group} using \code{rename_cols()}.
\item \strong{Optional elected processing}: If \code{SittingMemberFl} is present in the data, applies
\code{\link[=process_elected]{process_elected()}} to standardise it to an \code{Elected} column with "Y" or "N" values (specific
to 2004 logic in \code{\link[=process_elected]{process_elected()}}).
\item \strong{Unrecognised years}: Returns the data unprocessed with an informative message for years
other than 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, or 2019.
}
The function assumes the input data frame contains the required columns (\code{event} and \code{Ticket}) for
the specified processing years, as sourced from the AEC Senate datasets listed.
