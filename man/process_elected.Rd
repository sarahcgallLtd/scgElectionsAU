\title{Process Election Data for Elected Candidates}
\usage{
process_elected(data, event)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing election data for a single election event. Must include an
\code{event} column with a single unique value (e.g., "2004"). Additional columns depend on the specific dataset.}

\item{event}{A character string specifying the election event to process. Currently, only "2004 Federal Election" is
processed; other values result in the data being returned unprocessed.}
}
\value{
A data frame. For the 2004 Federal Election, it contains the standardised column:
\itemize{
\item \code{Elected} (indicates if the candidate was elected, with values "Y" for yes or "N" for no)
}
along with all other input columns. For unrecognised years, the original data frame is returned
unchanged.
}
\description{
Standardises election data related to elected candidates for a single Australian federal election
event. This function aligns column names across datasets, specifically processing the 2004 election
year by standardising the \code{Elected} column with "Y" or "N"
values. For all other election years, the data is returned unprocessed with a message. Applies to
datasets including "National list of candidates" (House and Senate), "First preferences by candidate
by vote type" (House only), "Two candidate preferred by candidate by vote type" (House only),
"Two candidate preferred by candidate by polling place" (House only), and "Distribution of preferences
by candidate by division" (House only).
}
\details{
This function processes election data by:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Formatting}: Converts \code{Elected} values to "Y" (elected) or "N" (not elected), replacing NA with "N".
\item \strong{Unrecognised years}: Returns the data unprocessed with an informative message for years other than
the 2004 Federal Election.
}
The function assumes the input data frame contains the required columns for the specified \code{event}
year and dataset, with processing currently implemented only for the 2004 Federal Election. Future enhancements may
include adding \code{HistoricVote} data for the 2004 Federal Election (pending identification of the source dataset).

# Sample 2004 data
data_2004 <- data.frame(
  date = "2004-10-09",
  event = "2004 Federal Election",
  CandidateID = 123,
  Elected = "#"
)
process_elected(data_2004, "2004 Federal Election")

# Sample unprocessed year (e.g., 2010)
data_2010 <- data.frame(
  date = "2010-08-21",
  event = "2010 Federal Election",
  CandidateID = 456,
  Elected = "Y"
)
process_elected(data_2010, "2010 Federal Election")
