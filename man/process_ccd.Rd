\title{Process Election Data by Census Collection District}
\usage{
process_ccd(data, event)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing election data with an \code{event} column indicating the election
year (e.g., "2013", "2016", "2019", "2022") and year-specific columns such as \code{state_ab},
\code{div_nm}, \code{pp_id}, \code{pp_nm}, and vote or area identifiers (e.g., \code{votes}, \code{count}, \code{ccd_id}, \code{SA1_id}).}

\item{event}{A character string specifying the election event to process. Recognised values are
"2013 Federal Election", "2016 Federal Election", "2019 Federal Election", or "2022 Federal
Election". Other values result in the data being returned unprocessed.}
}
\value{
A data frame. For recognised election events ("2013 Federal Election", "2016 Federal
Election", "2019 Federal Election", "2022 Federal Election", "2023 Referendum"), it contains
standardised columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{date} (if present in the input)
\item \code{event} (the election event)
\item \code{StateAb} (state abbreviation)
\item \code{DivisionNm} (division name)
\item \code{StatisticalAreaID} (statistical area identifier; refers to 2011 ASGC for 2013–2016,
2016 ASGC for 2019–2022)
\item \code{PollingPlaceID} (polling place identifier)
\item \code{PollingPlaceNm} (polling place name)
\item \code{Count} (indicative count of votes cast per statistical area)
}
The \code{year} column, if present, is removed as it is redundant with \code{event}. For unrecognised election
years, the original data frame is returned unchanged.
}
\description{
Standardises column names in election data across the 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2022 Australian federal
elections to ensure consistency. This function adjusts year-specific column names to a common set,
including renaming vote counts and statistical area identifiers, and removes redundant columns.
If an unrecognised election year is provided, the data is returned unprocessed with a message.
}
\details{
This function processes election data by:
\enumerate{
\item Applying base column renaming common to all recognised years using \code{rename_cols()}
(e.g., \code{state_ab} to \code{StateAb}, \code{div_nm} to \code{DivisionNm}).
\item Removing the \code{year} column, as the \code{event} column already provides this information.
\item For 2013: Renaming \code{ccd_id} to \code{StatisticalAreaID} and \code{count} to \code{Count}.
\item For 2016 and 2019: Renaming \code{SA1_id} to \code{StatisticalAreaID} and \code{votes} to \code{Count}.
\item For 2022: Renaming \code{ccd_id} to \code{StatisticalAreaID} and \code{votes} to \code{Count}.
\item For unrecognised years: Returning the data unprocessed with an informative message.
}
The function assumes the input data frame contains the required columns for the specified \code{event}
year, though column names may vary as per the original datasets. Note that \code{StatisticalAreaID}
reflects different Australian Statistical Geography Standards (ASGC) depending on the year:
2011 ASGC for 2013 and 2016, 2016 ASGC for 2019 and 2022.
