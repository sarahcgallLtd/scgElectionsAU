\usage{
get_election_data(
  file_name,
  date_range = list(from = "2025-01-01", to = "2026-01-01"),
  type = NULL,
  category = c("House", "Senate", "Referendum", "General", "Statistics"),
  process = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_name}{A character string specifying the name of the AEC dataset to retrieve (e.g.,
"National list of candidates"). This name must match entries in the internal index datasets.}

\item{date_range}{A list with two elements, \code{"from"} and \code{"to"}, specifying the start
and end dates (in "YYYY-MM-DD" format) for the election events to include. Defaults to
\code{list(from = "2022-01-01", to = "2025-01-01")}.}

\item{type}{A character string specifying the type of election or event. Must be one of:
"Federal Election", "Referendum", "By-Election", or "Disclosure". Defaults to the first option.}

\item{category}{A character string specifying the category of the data. Must be one of: "House",
"Senate", "Referendum", "General", or "Statistics". Defaults to the first option.}

\item{process}{A logical value indicating whether to apply additional processing to the downloaded
data, such as standardizing column names. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the combined AEC data for the specified criteria. The data frame
includes metadata columns (e.g., \code{date}, \code{event}) and is optionally processed
for consistency if \code{process = TRUE}. If no data is available for the given parameters,
the function stops with an informative error message.
}
\description{
This function downloads and processes data from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) based
on user-specified criteria such as file name, date range, election type, and data category. It
retrieves raw data files from the AEC, optionally applies standardisation processes (e.g., column
name consistency), and returns a combined data frame for analysis. The function is designed to
handle various types of election-related datasets, including federal elections, referendums,
and by-elections.
}
\details{
The \code{get_aec_data} function automates the retrieval and processing of AEC datasets by:
\enumerate{
\item Validating input parameters to ensure correctness.
\item Retrieving internal metadata about election events within the specified \code{date_range}
and matching the \code{type}.
\item Checking the availability of the requested \code{file_name} and \code{category} in the
internal index datasets.
\item Constructing download URLs and retrieving the raw data files from the AEC website.
\item Optionally preprocessing postal vote data and standardizing column names.
\item Combining data from multiple election events into a single data frame.
}
The function relies on internal helper functions (e.g., \code{check_params}, \code{construct_url},
\code{preprocess_pva}) and datasets (e.g., \code{info}, \code{aec_elections_index}) within the
\code{scgElectionsAU} package. It also uses \code{scgUtils::get_file} for downloading files.
The function is designed to be robust, providing clear messages and errors to guide users through
the data retrieval process.

  # Retrieve and process the national list of candidates for House elections in 2022
