\usage{
process_pva_party(data, event)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing PVA data for a single election event. Must include an \code{event}
column with a single unique value (e.g., "2010", "2013", "2016", "2019"). Additional required
columns vary by year:
\itemize{
\item 2010: \code{Enrolment}, and party-specific columns (e.g., \code{Labor}, \code{Liberal}, \code{AEC}).
\item 2013: \verb{Enrolment Division}, and additional party columns (e.g., \code{Liberal-National}).
\item 2016 and 2019: \code{State_Cd}, \code{PVA_Web_1_Party_Div}, and AEC-specific columns (e.g., \code{AEC - OPVA}).
}
A \code{date} column is optional.}

\item{event}{A character string specifying the election year to process. Recognised values are
"2010", "2013", "2016", or "2019". Other values result in the data being returned unprocessed.}
}
\value{
A data frame with standardised columns for recognised election years:
\itemize{
\item \code{date} (the date of the election or data snapshot)
\item \code{event} (the election year)
\item \code{StateAb} (state abbreviation, upper case; "ZZZ" for NA in 2013)
\item \code{DivisionNm} (division name)
\item \code{GPV} (general postal voter applications; included for 2013, 2016, 2019 only)
\item \code{AEC (Online)} (AEC online applications; included for 2013, 2016, 2019 only)
\item \code{AEC (Paper)} (AEC paper applications; included for 2013, 2016, 2019 only)
\item \code{AEC (Total)} (sum of AEC online and paper applications; all years)
\item \code{Total (AEC + Parties)} (sum of AEC total and party applications; all years except 2010)
\item \code{ALP} (Australian Labor Party applications; all years)
\item \code{CLP} (Country Liberal Party applications; all years)
\item \code{DEM} (Australian Democrats applications; 2019 only)
\item \code{GRN} (Greens applications; 2010, 2013, 2016 only)
\item \code{LIB} (Liberal Party applications; all years)
\item \code{LNP} (Liberal National Party applications; 2013, 2016, 2019 only)
\item \code{NAT} (National Party applications; all years)
\item \code{OTH} (Other party applications; all years)
}
For unrecognised years, the original data frame is returned unchanged.

\description{
Standardises and transforms Postal Vote Application (PVA) data for a single Australian federal
election event into a consistent structure. This function aligns column names across election
years (2010, 2013, 2016, 2019), calculates totals for Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)
applications (online and paper) and combined AEC-plus-party applications, and ensures a uniform
set of columns. For unrecognised election years, the data is returned unprocessed with a message.
}
\details{
This function processes PVA data by:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Standardising column names} across recognised election years using \code{rename_cols()}:
\itemize{
\item 2010: \code{Enrolment} to \code{DivisionNm}, party names (e.g., \code{Labor} to \code{ALP}).
\item 2013: \verb{Enrolment Division} to \code{DivisionNm}, additional party names (e.g., \code{Liberal-National} to \code{LNP}).
\item 2016 and 2019: \code{State_Cd} to \code{StateAb}, \code{PVA_Web_1_Party_Div} to \code{DivisionNm}, AEC columns (e.g., \code{AEC - OPVA} to \code{AEC (Online)}).
}
\item \strong{Handling missing states}: For 2013, NA in \code{StateAb} is replaced with "ZZZ".
\item \strong{Filtering rows}: For 2010 and 2013, rows with NA in \code{DivisionNm} (e.g., notes or totals) are removed.
\item \strong{Calculating totals}: For 2013, 2016, and 2019:
\itemize{
\item \code{AEC (Total)} is the sum of \code{AEC (Online)} and \code{AEC (Paper)}.
\item \code{Total (AEC + Parties)} is the sum of \code{AEC (Total)} and all party columns present.
}
\item \strong{Column selection}: Selects and reorders columns to a consistent set, retaining only those present in the data.
\item \strong{Formatting}: Converts \code{StateAb} to uppercase.
\item \strong{Unrecognised years}: Returns the data unprocessed with an informative message.
}

The function assumes the input data frame contains the required columns for the specified \code{event}
year and that the \code{event} column matches the \code{event} argument.
